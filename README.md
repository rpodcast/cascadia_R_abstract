## Title: Racing to the finish line: How R & Shiny fueled a virtual racing league

## Abstract

The global pandemic has impacted numerous aspects of our work and personal lives, with many of us learning new techniques for harnessing digital technology to engage with members of our favorite communities. A prominent and talented member of the Linux community took this opportunity to create their own niche tech community to bring new contributors to open-source software development and have some fun along the way with a friendly online racing league with the retro-looking Hotshot Racing PC racing game. I jumped at this chance of joining this friendly and talented group, and on top of the entertaining race session streamed on YouTube, we did what any group of Linux nerds would do: we created our own collection of over-the-top software built entirely with open-source!  As the sole statistician / data scientist of the group, I (naturally) saw this as a golden opportunity to bring a little R magic to the racing proceedings and analysis of the available results. In this talk, I will share the motivation behind creating three custom Shiny applications that turned an ordinary random number selector into a eye-catching car picker, extracted race results from in-game screenshots for real-time data collection, and an outrageous dashboard styled with the newest tooling in Shiny to make it look as if it was from the game itself. On top of inspiring the rest of our group to take a closer look at R, I hope my experience can inspire others in the R community to find creative ways for using their unique skills to foster new connections and have a little fun along the way.
